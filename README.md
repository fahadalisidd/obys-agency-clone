🚀 Obys Agency Clone
Welcome to the Obys Agency Clone – a pixel-perfect front-end recreation of the visually stunning and creatively immersive Obys Agency website. This project captures the essence of sleek design, smooth animations, and modern web aesthetics using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no frameworks, no shortcuts, just pure front-end craftsmanship.

🎯 About the Project
Inspired by the minimalist and artistic vibe of the original Obys Agency website, this clone replicates its:

🎨 Elegant layouts and typography

✨ Fluid scroll-based animations

🌀 Bold use of whitespace and movement

🔥 Micro-interactions and hover effects

The goal? To push the boundaries of what can be done with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – and to challenge myself to replicate a high-end, award-winning agency website from scratch.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Semantically structured markup

CSS3 – Custom animations, flexbox & grid layouts, transitions

JavaScript (ES6) – DOM manipulation, scroll animations, and interactivity

💡 Features
Fully responsive design

Scroll-triggered animations

Creative transitions & hover effects

Modular and clean code

Near-pixel-perfect resemblance to the original


🚧 What’s Not Included
This is a front-end only clone. Backend logic and dynamic content have not been implemented, staying true to the visual and interactive layer of the site and its not resposive.


🤝 A Learning Journey
This project was built as a way to:

Understand advanced layouts and animations

Practice real-world UI replication

Improve design-to-code translation skills

Feel free to copy, customize, or contribute – this is as much a learning sandbox as it is a showpiece!
